                    <p id="para1">The train pulled away just after Todd stepped onto it. He was traveling to Chicago for a business meeting. The meeting was on Thursday and he wanted to explore the city for a few days before the meeting.

He pulled out his travel map and started to make plans. "I hope I have enough time to visit all of the sites I want to see" he thought.</p>
